# closures

This is a fork of [petit-dom](https://github.com/yelouafi/petit-dom) by Yassine Elouafi, but with added "closure components" inspired by [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/components.html#closure-component-state). For more thorough documentation, checkout the README for `petit-dom`. **This is experimental and not well-tested, so I recommend using Mithril.js or Preact instead.**
